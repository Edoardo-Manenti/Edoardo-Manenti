# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi, I’m **Edoardo Manenti** — a software engineer who’s passionate about the **art of problem solving**. I love diving into **data structures**, **algorithms**, and taking on **programming challenges** that stretch my thinking and sharpen my skills.

## 💡 What Drives Me

- 🧠 Exploring data structures and algorithms deeply — not just solving problems, but understanding the *why* behind the solutions.
- 💻 Tackling real-world challenges through clean, efficient code.
- 🚀 Building, breaking, and learning through side projects and code experiments.

## 📦 Pinned Projects

Here’s a peek into some of my featured repositories:

### 🔹 `leetcode-solutions`
A curated collection of my solutions to LeetCode challenges — includes optimized approaches, comments, and complexity breakdowns. My evolving reference for sharpening algorithmic thinking.

### 🔹 `algorithms-playground`
My personal sandbox for implementing classic algorithms and data structures from scratch. Think recursion, dynamic programming, graph traversal, and more — no shortcuts, just fundamentals.

### 🔹 `project-x` *(placeholder name — replace with actual)*
A small but mighty app built with [insert stack, e.g., React + Node.js], designed to [describe what it does]. Great example of building an idea from scratch and shipping it.
