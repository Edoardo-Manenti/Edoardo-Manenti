# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

Hi, I’m **Edoardo Manenti** — a software engineer who’s passionate about the **art of problem solving**. I love diving into **data structures**, **algorithms**, and taking on **programming challenges** that stretch my thinking and sharpen my skills.

## 💡 What Drives Me

- 🧠 Exploring data structures and algorithms deeply — not just solving problems, but understanding the *why* behind the solutions.
- 💻 Tackling real-world challenges through clean, efficient code.
- 🚀 Building, breaking, and learning through side projects and code experiments.

## 📦 Pinned Projects

Here’s a peek into some of my featured repositories:

### 🔹 [`ImageFilteringHE`](https://github.com/Edoardo-Manenti/ImageFilteringHE)
An image filtering project using **homomorphic encryption** (HE) techniques. It explores how we can perform operations like edge detection directly on encrypted images — preserving privacy while still enabling computation. A blend of security, math, and image processing.

### 🔹 [`AOC_2024`](https://github.com/Edoardo-Manenti/AOC_2024)
My daily solutions for **Advent of Code 2024** — a December coding challenge series. This repo documents not only the solutions but also the thought process and techniques used for each problem. A fun and festive way to grow algorithmic skills one puzzle at a time.

### 🔹 [`SortingVisualizer`](https://github.com/Edoardo-Manenti/SortingVisualizer)
A visual exploration of popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Built to make the behavior of algorithms more intuitive and engaging — because sometimes, watching the process is just as satisfying as understanding it.
